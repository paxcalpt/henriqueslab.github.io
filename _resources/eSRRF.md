eSRRF (enhanced Super-Resolution Radial Fluctuations) is an extension of the SRRF method developed by the Henriques lab, described in Gustafsson et al. (2016). eSRRF aims at improving the fidelity of SRRF images with respect to the underlying true structure. Below is shown a representative dataset obtained from high-density emitters for which the underlying structure was obtained via DNA-PAINT (SMLM).
