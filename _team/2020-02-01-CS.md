<b>My past:</b> I studied biology in the beautiful and romantic city Würzburg in Germany. Afterwards, I moved to Frankfurt to do my PhD in Mike Heilemann research group, investigating nucleoid architecture in E. coli cells using single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM), a super-resolution approach that provides near molecular resolution. After figuring out how to directly label the nucleoid and how to combine different super-resolution methods (which took some time), my work resulted in several imaging approaches that allow for three-color SMLM in individual cells at spatial resolutions of ~ 20 – 40 nm. This is exactly what we require to explore the inner life of bugs at the nanoscale and understand how different processes and stimuli affect bacterial homeostasis and nucleoid organization.
<br>
<b>My present:</b> With the developed toolbox, I investigate how E. coli cells replicate and segregate their chromosome and how biological processes such as transcription and translation shape the nucleoid in a dynamic manner. As most of my work was performed in fixed specimen, I am very happy to join the Henriques group as an EMBO short term fellow, to perform live-cell imaging and ultimately provide a dynamic, super-resolved picture of bacterial chromosome replication.
<br>
<b>My future:</b> I want to use super-resolution microscopy to gain a deep understanding of how antimicrobial compounds perturb microbial cell homeostasis. This knowledge will become extremely important for fighting antimicrobial resistance and designing new drugs.
