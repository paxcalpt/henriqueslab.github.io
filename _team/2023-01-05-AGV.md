<p> <b>Overview:</b> Arturo joined our laboratory as a postdoc in January 2022. In recent years Arturo has devoted himself to developing single-molecule optical experimental approaches to the study of protein-lipid interactions, focusing on spectroscopy methods and 3D orientation in single-molecule. His current interest is single-molecule localization microscopy, in particular in the development of computational tools to analyze and process super-resolution microscopy data in 3D volumetric data.
