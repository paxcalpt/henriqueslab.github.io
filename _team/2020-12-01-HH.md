<p> <b>Overview:</b>
Coming from a background of semiconductor physics and nanofabrication switched over to the Biophysics and fluorescence microscopy field for my Master studies and my PhD. I love working in an interdisciplinary team to study cell biology by combining biophotonics and high-end microscopy. In the Henriques Lab I will establish automated and intelligent super-resolution microscopy to study host pathogen interactions.
