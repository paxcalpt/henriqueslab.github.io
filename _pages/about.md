# We're moving our website !!!

We've just moved to a new website in _[henriqueslab.org](https://henriqueslab.org)_. We're still in the process of migrating content, so please bear with us. For our most updated content, please visit us _[there](https://henriqueslab.org)_.
<meta http-equiv = "refresh" content = "3; url = https://henriqueslab.org" />

### Who are we

We like to think of ourselves as <b>optical cell biologists</b>. We focus on addressing <b>biomedical questions</b> by exploiting advancements we develop in <b>optical microscopy</b>. To do so, we create <b>open-technology</b> that pushes the boundaries of <b>cellular imaging</b>. All our research and methods are transparent, reproducible and widely available to researchers. In biology, we tackle broad <b>virology, host-pathogen interactions, immunology and cell signalling</b> questions. We do so by establishing <b>new classes of fluorescent probes, high-speed cell-friendly super-resolution methods and computational modelling approaches</b> that, although designed to answer questions of interest in the lab, have extensive cross-disciplinary applications.

### The Laboratory

In 2020, we moved the laboratory to [Instituto Gulbenkian de Ciência](https://gulbenkian.pt/ciencia/) from the [MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/lmcb/) in [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/), where the group was founded in 2013. Between 2017 and 2020 we've had an additional small laboratory at [The Francis Crick Institute](https://www.crick.ac.uk/). Check out our [research page](research) to know more about what we do.
