<h2> Abstract </h2>
<p align= "justify">
Unwanted sample drift is a common issue that plagues microscopy experiments, preventing accurate temporal visualization and quantification of biological processes. Although multiple methods and tools exist to correct images post acquisition, performing drift correction of three-dimensional (3D) videos using open-source solutions remains challenging and time consuming. Here, we present a new tool developed for ImageJ or Fiji called Fast4DReg that can quickly correct axial and lateral drift in 3D video-microscopy datasets. Fast4DReg works by creating intensity projections along multiple axes and estimating the drift between frames using two-dimensional cross-correlations. Using synthetic and acquired datasets, we demonstrate that Fast4DReg can perform better than other state-of-the-art open-source drift-correction tools and significantly outperforms them in speed. We also demonstrate that Fast4DReg can be used to register misaligned channels in 3D using either calibration slides or misaligned images directly. Altogether, Fast4DReg provides a quick and easy-to-use method to correct 3D imaging data before further visualization and analysis.
